# todo-slash-command
A .claude slash command to manage a simple todo list in your project's root directory, without having to leave Claude Code! Todos are stored in `todos.md` at your project root and automatically numbered for easy reference.

## Inspiration
You ever been in the midst of a vibe-session and thought, "Oh, I need to fix the padding on that button". Well, no need to even leave the claude interface. Just use this `/todo` slash-command to create and manage a simple todo list for your project, from **within** your project.

Once the `todos.md` file is created in your project's root directory, you can probably even just tell claude to add to it without having to use the slash-command, but the slash-command provides some nifty commands for your benefit.

## Install
Download [todo.md](todo.md) or copy its contents and place it in 1 of 2 locations...

### 1. Personal command (âœ¨ recommended)
...your home directory: `~/.claude/commands/todos.md`.

**Note:** This will make the command available across **all** your projects.

### 2. Project command
...your project's root directory: `[your project's root directory]/.claude/commands/todos.md`.

**Note:** This will store the command in your repository and allow it to be shared with your team
